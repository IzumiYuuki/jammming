# Jammming - A React Web Application

## Project Overview
Jammming is a React-based web application that allows users to search for songs using the Spotify API, create custom playlists, and save them to their personal Spotify accounts. This project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, API requests, and user authentication.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language for the application.
- **HTML & CSS**: Markup and styling.
- **Spotify API**: For searching songs and managing playlists.
- **Fetch API**: For handling HTTP requests.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting.
- **Deployment Platform**: (To be decided, e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for songs by song title, and optionally by artist or genre.
- **Song Information Display**: Displays the title, artist, and album for each searched song.
- **Playlist Creation**: Users can create a custom playlist by adding or removing songs.
- **Spotify Integration**: Allows users to log in and save their custom playlists to their Spotify account.

## Future Work
- Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations.
- Add functionality to search by additional attributes (e.g., genre, album, popularity, etc.).
- Implement additional authentication features.
- Enhance error handling for API requests.
- Optimize performance for faster API responses.
